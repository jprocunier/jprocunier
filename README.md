- 👋 Hi, my name is Jessi
- 👀 I’m interested in object-oriented programming (and when I'm not programming, I love baking and playing Mario Party)
- 🌱 I have a degree in Computer Engineering from UNC Charlotte, where we primarily used C++, but I'm also learning Java and HTML
- 💞️ I’m currently looking for a software engineering position either remote or near the Fort Mill, SC area!
